## Probing Dark Matter with the IceCube Upgrade

To run these notebooks one needs:

nuflux 

pandas 

pickle 

healpy 

tqdm 

scipy 

matplotlib 

numpy 

The two notebooks DMann.ipynb and DMdecay.ipynb are both simulations of dark matter emission, but DMann.ipynb is already setup for dark matter annihilation and DMdecay.ipynb is setup for dark matter decay. 

The data file neutrino_mc.csv is Monte Carlo neutrino data from ceCube Upgrade Neutrino Monte Carlo Simulation. 

The data file ann_flux.pickle is neutrino spectra from PPPC4 DM ID for dark matter masses of 10 GeV, 30 GeV, 100 GeV, 300 Gev and 1000 GeV with the channels $b \overline{b}$, $W^+W^-$, $\tau^+ \tau ^-$ and $\nu_{\mu} \overline{\nu}_{\mu}$.
